About Sondermaschine (special machine)
In the late 1980s, a strange Enigma machine was dicovered in the house of a former intelligence officer, who used to work for a special unit. Basically, this machine was a standard Enigma-I, of which the wiring of the wheels and the UKW had been changed. For this reason, the machine and the wheels were were marked with the letter 'S', which probably means Sondermaschine (special machine). The wooden case is marked A1807S, whilst the machine is labelled 17401S/jla/43. The UKW is engraved with A19872S.
